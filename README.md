# ohw21-proj-gliders
Make glider data on erddap servers visualizable.


The goal of this project is to create a notebook that can take glider data from ERDDAP server (could use: https://github.com/ioos/gliderpy) and then use the type of dashboard created in https://github.com/earthcube2021/ec21_balwada_etal (also shared in old_viz_files) to create interactive visuals.
